A web search engine software system designed search information World Wide Web . The search results generally presented line results often referred search engine results pages ( SERPs ) . The information may mix web pages , images , types files . Some search engines also mine data available databases open directories . Unlike web directories , maintained human editors , search engines also maintain real-time information running algorithm web crawler . Internet content capable searched web search engine generally described deep web . Internet search engines predate debut Web December 1990 . The Who user search dates back 1982 [ 1 ] Knowbot Information Service multi-network user search first implemented 1989 . [ 2 ] The first well documented search engine searched content files , namely FTP files Archie , debuted 10 September 1990 . [ 3 ] Prior September 1993 World Wide Web entirely indexed hand . There list webservers edited Tim Berners-Lee hosted CERN webserver . One Google.nl snapshot list 1992 remains , [ 4 ] web servers went online central list could longer keep . On NCSA site , new servers announced title `` What 's New ! `` [ 5 ] The first tool used searching content ( opposed users ) Internet Archie . [ 6 ] The name stands `` archive '' without `` v '' . It created Alan Emtage , Bill Heelan J. Peter Deutsch , computer science students McGill University Montreal , Quebec , Canada . The program downloaded directory listings files located public anonymous FTP ( File Transfer Protocol ) sites , creating searchable database file names ; however , Archie Search Engine index contents sites since amount data limited could readily searched manually . The rise Gopher ( created 1991 Mark McCahill University Minnesota ) led two new search programs , Veronica Jughead . Like Archie , searched file names titles stored Gopher index systems . Veronica ( Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index Computerized Archives ) provided keyword search Gopher menu titles entire Gopher listings . Jughead ( Jonzy 's Universal Gopher Hierarchy Excavation And Display ) tool obtaining menu information specific Gopher servers . While name search engine `` Archie Search Engine '' reference Archie comic book series , `` Veronica '' `` Jughead '' characters series , thus referencing predecessor . In summer 1993 , search engine existed web , though numerous specialized catalogues maintained hand . Oscar Nierstrasz University Geneva wrote series Perl scripts periodically mirrored pages rewrote standard format . This formed basis W3Catalog , web 's first primitive search engine , released September 2 , 1993 . [ 7 ] In June 1993 , Matthew Gray , MIT , produced probably first web robot , Perl-based World Wide Web Wanderer , used generate index called 'Wandex ' . The purpose Wanderer measure size World Wide Web , late 1995 . The web 's second search engine Aliweb appeared November 1993 . Aliweb use web robot , instead depended notified website administrators existence site index file particular format . NCSA 's Mosaic™ - Mosaic ( web browser ) n't first Web browser , first make major splash . In November 1993 , Mosaic v1.0 broke away small pack existing browsers including features like icons , bookmarks , attractive interface , pictures , made software easy use appealing `` non-geeks . '' JumpStation ( created December 1993 [ 8 ] Jonathon Fletcher ) used web robot find web pages build index , used web form interface query program . It thus first WWW resource-discovery tool combine three essential features web search engine ( crawling , indexing , searching ) described . Because limited resources available platform ran , indexing hence searching limited titles headings found web pages crawler encountered . One first `` text '' crawler-based search engines WebCrawler , came 1994 . Unlike predecessors , allowed users search word webpage , become standard major search engines since . It also search engine widely known public . Also 1994 , Lycos ( started Carnegie Mellon University ) launched became major commercial endeavor . Soon , many search engines appeared vied popularity . These included Magellan , Excite , Infoseek , Inktomi , Northern Light , AltaVista . Yahoo ! among popular ways people find web pages interest , search function operated web directory , rather full-text copies web pages . Information seekers could also browse directory instead keyword-based search . In 1996 , Netscape looking give single search engine exclusive deal featured search engine Netscape 's web browser . There much interest instead Netscape struck deals five major search engines : $ 5 million year , search engine would rotation Netscape search engine page . The five engines Yahoo ! , Magellan , Lycos , Infoseek , Excite . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Google adopted idea selling search terms 1998 , small search engine company named goto.com . This move significant effect SE business , went struggling one profitable businesses internet . [ 11 ] Search engines also known brightest stars Internet investing frenzy occurred late 1990s . [ 12 ] Several companies entered market spectacularly , receiving record gains initial public offerings . Some taken public search engine , marketing enterprise-only editions , Northern Light . Many search engine companies caught dot-com bubble , speculation-driven market boom peaked 1999 ended 2001 . By 2000 , Yahoo ! providing search services based Inktomi 's search engine . Yahoo ! acquired Inktomi 2002 , Overture ( owned AlltheWeb AltaVista ) 2003 . Yahoo ! switched Google 's search engine 2004 , launched search engine based combined technologies acquisitions . Microsoft first launched MSN Search fall 1998 using search results Inktomi . In early 1999 site began display listings Looksmart , blended results Inktomi . For short time 1999 , MSN Search used results AltaVista instead . In 2004 , Microsoft began transition search technology , powered web crawler ( called msnbot ) . Microsoft 's rebranded search engine , Bing , launched June 1 , 2009 . On July 29 , 2009 , Yahoo ! Microsoft finalized deal Yahoo ! Search would powered Microsoft Bing technology . A search engine maintains following processes near real time : Web search engines get information web crawling site site . The `` spider '' checks standard filename robots.txt , addressed , sending certain information back indexed depending many factors , titles , page content , JavaScript , Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) , headings , evidenced standard HTML markup informational content , metadata HTML meta tags . `` [ N ] web crawler may actually crawl entire reachable web . Due infinite websites , spider traps , spam , exigencies real web , crawlers instead apply crawl policy determine crawling site deemed sufficient . Some sites crawled exhaustively , others crawled partially '' . [ 16 ] Indexing means associating words definable tokens found web pages domain names HTML-based fields . The associations made public database , made available web search queries . A query user single word . The index helps find information relating query quickly possible . [ 15 ] Some techniques indexing , caching trade secrets , whereas web crawling straightforward process visiting sites systematic basis . Between visits spider , cached version page ( content needed render ) stored search engine working memory quickly sent inquirer . If visit overdue , search engine act web proxy instead . In case page may differ search terms indexed . [ 15 ] The cached page holds appearance version whose words indexed , cached version page useful web site actual page lost , problem also considered mild form linkrot . Typically user enters query search engine keywords . [ 17 ] The index already names sites containing keywords , instantly obtained index . The real processing load generating web pages search results list : Every page entire list must weighted according information indexes . [ 15 ] Then top search result item requires lookup , reconstruction , markup snippets showing context keywords matched . These part processing search results web page requires , pages ( next top ) require post processing . Beyond simple keyword lookups , search engines offer GUI- command-driven operators search parameters refine search results . These provide necessary controls user engaged feedback loop users create filtering weighting refining search results , given initial pages first search results . For example , 2007 Google.com search engine allowed one filter date clicking `` Show search tools '' leftmost column initial search results page , selecting desired date range . [ 18 ] It 's also possible weight date page modification time . Most search engines support use boolean operators AND , OR NOT help end users refine search query . Boolean operators literal searches allow user refine extend terms search . The engine looks words phrases exactly entered . Some search engines provide advanced feature called proximity search , allows users define distance keywords . [ 15 ] There also concept-based searching research involves using statistical analysis pages containing words phrases search . As well , natural language queries allow user type question form one would ask human . [ 19 ] A site like would ask.com . [ 20 ] The usefulness search engine depends relevance result set gives back . While may millions web pages include particular word phrase , pages may relevant , popular , authoritative others . Most search engines employ methods rank results provide `` best '' results first . How search engine decides pages best matches , order results shown , varies widely one engine another . [ 15 ] The methods also change time Internet usage changes new techniques evolve . There two main types search engine evolved : one system predefined hierarchically ordered keywords humans programmed extensively . The system generates `` inverted index '' analyzing texts locates . This first form relies much heavily computer bulk work . Most Web search engines commercial ventures supported advertising revenue thus allow advertisers listings ranked higher search results fee . Search engines accept money search results make money running search related ads alongside regular search engine results . The search engines make money every time someone clicks one ads . [ 21 ] Google world 's popular search engine , market share 90.14 percent February , 2018 . [ 22 ] The world 's popular search engines ( > 2 % market share ) : In East Asian countries Russia , Google popular search engine . In Russia , Yandex commands marketshare 61.9 percent , compared Google 's 28.3 percent . [ 23 ] In China , Baidu popular search engine . [ 24 ] South Korea 's homegrown search portal , Naver , used 70 percent online searches country . [ 25 ] Yahoo ! Japan Yahoo ! Taiwan popular avenues internet search Japan Taiwan , respectively . [ 26 ] Most countries ' markets Western Europe dominated Google , except Czech Republic , Seznam strong competitor . [ 27 ] Although search engines programmed rank websites based combination popularity relevancy , empirical studies indicate various political , economic , social biases information provide [ 28 ] [ 29 ] underlying assumptions technology . [ 30 ] These biases direct result economic commercial processes ( e.g. , companies advertise search engine become also popular organic search results ) , political processes ( e.g. , removal search results comply local laws ) . [ 31 ] For example , Google surface certain neo-Nazi websites France Germany , Holocaust denial illegal . Biases also result social processes , search engine algorithms frequently designed exclude non-normative viewpoints favor `` popular '' results . [ 32 ] Indexing algorithms major search engines skew towards coverage U.S.-based sites , rather websites non-U.S . countries . [ 29 ] Google Bombing one example attempt manipulate search results political , social commercial reasons . Several scholars studied cultural changes triggered search engines , [ 33 ] representation certain controversial topics results , terrorism Ireland [ 34 ] conspiracy theories . [ 35 ] Many search engines Google Bing provide customized results based user 's activity history . This leads effect called filter bubble . The term describes phenomenon websites use algorithms selectively guess information user would like see , based information user ( location , past click behaviour search history ) . As result , websites tend show information agrees user 's past viewpoint . This puts user state intellectual isolation without contrary information . Prime examples Google 's personalized search results Facebook 's personalized news stream . According Eli Pariser , coined term , users get less exposure conflicting viewpoints isolated intellectually informational bubble . Pariser related example one user searched Google `` BP '' got investment news British Petroleum another searcher got information Deepwater Horizon oil spill two search results pages `` strikingly different '' . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] The bubble effect may negative implications civic discourse , according Pariser . [ 39 ] Since problem identified , competing search engines emerged seek avoid problem tracking `` bubbling '' users , DuckDuckGo . Other scholars share Pariser 's view , finding evidence support thesis unconvincing . [ 40 ] The global growth Internet electronic media Arab Muslim World last decade encouraged Islamic adherents Middle East Asian sub-continent , attempt search engines , filtered search portals would enable users perform safe searches . More usual safe search filters , Islamic web portals categorizing websites either `` halal '' `` haram '' , based modern , expert , interpretation `` Law Islam '' . ImHalal came online September 2011 . Halalgoogling came online July 2013 . These use haram filters collections Google Bing ( others ) . [ 41 ] While lack investment slow pace technologies Muslim World hindered progress thwarted success Islamic search engine , targeting main consumers Islamic adherents , projects like Muxlim , Muslim lifestyle site , receive millions dollars investors like Rite Internet Ventures , also faltered . Other religion-oriented search engines Jewgle , Jewish version Google , SeekFind.org , Christian . SeekFind filters sites attack degrade faith . [ 42 ] Search engine submission process webmaster submits website directly search engine . While search engine submission sometimes presented way promote website , generally necessary major search engines use web crawlers , eventually find web sites Internet without assistance . They either submit one web page time , submit entire site using sitemap , normally necessary submit home page web site search engines able crawl well designed website . There two remaining reasons submit web site web page search engine : add entirely new web site without waiting search engine discover , web site 's record updated substantial redesign . Some search engine submission software submits websites multiple search engines , also add links websites pages . This could appear helpful increasing website 's ranking , external links one important factors determining website 's ranking . However , John Mueller Google stated `` lead tremendous number unnatural links site '' negative impact site ranking . [ 43 ]
